# Zero Trust Security Compliance Assessment

## Project Overview  
This project conducts a **Zero Trust Security Compliance Assessment** for a fictional company, **ABC Corp**. The goal is to evaluate the organization‚Äôs security posture, identify compliance gaps, and provide recommendations to align with **Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)** as defined by **NIST 800-207**.

## Zero Trust Principles Covered
- **Identity & Access Management (IAM)**
- **Least Privilege Access Controls**
- **Network Segmentation**
- **Endpoint Security**
- **Data Protection & Encryption**
- **Continuous Monitoring & Threat Detection**

## Use Case Scenario: ABC Corp  
ABC Corp, a mid-sized enterprise, is transitioning to a **Zero Trust security model**. This assessment helps them align with security frameworks such as:
- **NIST 800-207 (Zero Trust Architecture)**
- **ISO 27001 (Information Security Management)**
- **CIS Controls (Cybersecurity Best Practices)**
- **NIST 800-53 (Security and Privacy Controls)**

---

## Assessment Methodology  
The assessment is conducted in **five** key steps:

### **1. Define the Zero Trust Scope**
- Identify key assets, users, and resources.
- Determine compliance requirements (e.g., NIST, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS).
- Assess current security policies.

### **2. Conduct a Security Assessment**
- Identity & Access Management (MFA, RBAC, authentication).
- Network Security (micro-segmentation, firewalls, VPN alternatives).
- Endpoint Security (EDR, device authentication).
- Data Protection (encryption, audit logs).
- Continuous Monitoring (SIEM, XDR, behavioral analytics).

### **3. Identify Compliance Gaps**
- Use a **Zero Trust Maturity Model** to assess the current state.
- Identify security weaknesses that could lead to **data breaches, insider threats, or compliance violations**.

### **4. Provide Recommendations**
- **Short-term fixes** (e.g., enforcing MFA, disabling outdated protocols).
- **Long-term improvements** (e.g., implementing Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)).

### **5. Generate Compliance Reports**
Deliverables include:
- **Zero Trust Compliance Checklist** (Excel/Google Sheet).
- **Executive Summary** üìÑ (PDF/Presentation).
- **Security Recommendations Roadmap**
